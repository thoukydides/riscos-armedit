    Parameters  : handle    - The user specified handle.
    Returns     : void
    Description : A function that is called after the user has responded to a
                  prompt to quit by selecting the continue option. This should
                  perform an operation equivalent to marking the data as read.
                  This allows the quit to continue further if it is restarted.

    Parameters  : handle    - The user specified handle.
                  func      - Variable to receive a pointer to the function
                              to call if the user selects the quit option.
    Returns     : char *    - Prompt for the user, or NULL if no objection.
    Description : A function that is called when the software is about to quit.
                  If a string is returned then the user is prompted to allow
                  the quit to be aborted or continued.

    Parameters  : void

                  handlers and offers any child tasks the opportunity to
                  object. This should normally only be used when a menu
                  option is selected; quit messages from the task manager
                  or other tasks are handled automatically.

                  There is no need to deregister the task; the task is
                  automatically unregistered when it exits.
