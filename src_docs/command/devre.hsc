<CMD CMD="ARMEdit_DevicesRelog" DESC="Discard the device driver directory cache">
<CMDS>[-now]</CMDS>
<CMDP PARAM="-now">force immediate reset</CMDP>
<CMDU>
    Force a relog of the RISC OS directory structure. This releases most of the memory claimed to support device driver operation and closes open files.
    <P>
    Note that this may not take immediate effect - DOS must acknowledge a change of disc before any relog occurs. This normally occurs if no files are open on the device, and a simple operation (such as typing <ARG>DIR</ARG>) is performed on the drive. Note that each emulated device is treated seperately; some devices may be reset before others.
    <P>
    The <ARG>-now</ARG> switch forces an immediate reset. This should only be used if essential, and must never be used in the middle of a disc access, otherwise DOS could be confused by an inconsistent disc image.
    <P>
    It can be useful to call this from the DOS command line using the OSCLI command (supplied as part of the <ARMEDIT> suite) - perhaps it should be placed in a DOS batch file for easier use.
