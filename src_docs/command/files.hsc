    This command displays details of the RISC OS files currently open for PC software. For each open file the file handle and filename is displayed. There is also a field that indicates whether the file will automatically be deleted when it is closed (either explicitly by the PC software, or when the PC is reset or quit).
    <P>
    Any files opened for the device driver are also listed.
