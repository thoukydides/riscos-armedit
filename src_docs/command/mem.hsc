    This command displays details of the RISC OS memory currently being used by PC software. For each block of memory claimed the base address and size of the block is displayed.
    <P>
    The memory is currently allocated from the RMA, but a header is attached to the start of each block. Hence the address displayed is not the start of a heap block. The information in the header is used to automatically release the memory when the PC is reset or quit if the PC software fails to do so.
