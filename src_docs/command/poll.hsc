<CMDU>
    This command allows the multitasking speed of the PC card to be controlled. Larger values increase the performance of the PC card at the expense of slowing down the desktop. A value of 0 results in the normal behaviour.
    <P>
    Use with no parameters to display the current settings. If only a single value is specified (without switches) then both settings are updated.
    <P>
    This command should not be used with versions of the PC card software that provide more direct control over the multitasking speed.
