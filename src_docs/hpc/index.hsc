<HEADING>HPC</HEADING>
<PARA>
The <ARMEDIT> module provides a number of High-level Procedure Call (HPC) services. To allow development to start before HPC is included in the PC front-end software, and to support earlier releases of the front-end software, a simplified interface via <A HREF=":hpc/io.html" TITLE="I/O Port Access">I/O ports</A> is also supported.
<P>
All of these services use the HPC service identifier &amp;105 which has been allocated by Aleph One.
<P>
For details of making HPC calls directly (which is potentially much more
efficient) contact Aleph One, as the information is covered by a Non
Disclosure Agreement.
<P>
Several users have found that using the complete 16384 byte buffer size can
lead to message corruption on some installations. It is strongly recommended
that where variable messages sizes can be used that these are restricted to
less than 4096 bytes. All of the code supplied with this release uses the
lower limit but support is retained for larger messages.
<P>

The following SWIs are implemented by the <ARMEDIT> module. For more details
regarding the use of the communciations SWIs see the Code documentation.
