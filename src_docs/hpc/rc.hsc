<HEADING>Return Codes</HEADING>
<PARA>
All of the HPC calls place a 4 byte return code at the start of the return
block. The generic values are:
<TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
    <TR><TH>Status</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
    <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&amp;0000</TD><TD>The operation was successful.</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&amp;0001</TD><TD>The operation failed. The exact meaning of this depends upon the reason code, but in general it indicates that the rest of the return block is invalid.</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&amp;FFFF</TD><TD>Service or reason code is unknown.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
See the individual reason codes for details of any other codes returned, and
any contents of the remainder of the return block.
