        This call may either be used to test HPC services, or to provide access to the routines from a system that does not support either of the communications systems used normally by the <ARMEDIT> system.
        <P>
        For convenience the input and output data may be split into two portions. Any length value may be zero to omit that portion. The input data must be at least two bytes long to contain a valid ID.
