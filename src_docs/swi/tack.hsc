        After reading a message with <SWIL SWI="ARMEdit_TalkRX">, this call should be used to claim the message, and to prevent it being offered to other clients. This should be used before calling any other SWIs from this module.
        <P>
        If the message was sent by the <ARMEDIT> module then calling this SWI has no effect; other clients still receive the message.
