        This is like <SWIL SWI="ARMEdit_TalkTX" HREF=":swi/ttx.html">, except that the message is stored in the destination task's message buffer. The destination task must be specified by it's client handle; it is not possible to send the message to an ID.
        <P>
        The main use of this call is to support the easy creation of RISC OS tasks acting as a server for multiple PC tasks.
