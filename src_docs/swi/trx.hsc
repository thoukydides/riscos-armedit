        Check for any waiting messages. If none are available R0 contains 0 on exit, otherwise it contains a pointer to the first message. The message should be checked, and if it is claimed <SWIL SWI="ARMEdit_TalkAck"> or <SWIL SWI="ARMEdit_TalkReply"> should be called to prevent it being passed to other clients. Any information required from the message must be read or copied immediately, since the message could be overwritten by a new message.
        <P>
        The specified source client handle should be used for any reply; unlike the ID it uniquely identifies a particular instantiation of a client.
        <P>
        If this call is successful then it should be called again; it is possible for multiple messages to be pending for a single client.
