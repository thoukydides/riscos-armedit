        An application that provides services to PC software should call this when it is starting. A message buffer is allocated and a unique handle for this task assigned. This handle should be stored and used in all other calls relating to this task.
        <P>
        The currently defined flag bits are:
        <TABLE BORDER=1 ALIGN=CENTER>
            <TR><TH>Bit</TH><TH>Meaning if set</TH></TR>
            <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>0</TD><TD>Messages from the <ARMEDIT> module are required.</TD></TR>
        </TABLE>
        <P>
        All other bits should be set to 0 to allow for future expansion.
        <P>
        The poll word is initially set to zero. When there is potentially a message waiting for this task the poll word is set to a non-zero value. The poll word is cleared when either the message has been read, or no message is available for some other reason. Note that a non-zero poll word does not imply that a message will be available; another task might have read the message if it was not directed to a specific handle. The poll word must not be written to; it must only be modified by the <ARMEDIT> module.
