INTRODUCTION

The ARMEdit module forms the core of the ARMEdit suite of software. It
provides the communications between software running on the PC card and
RISC OS.

The module should normally be loaded after the desktop has been started, but
before the PC front-end has been loaded. However, if Wimp$ScrapDir is set to
a suitable value then the module may be loaded before the desktop has been
entered. A good place for loading the ARMEdit module is in the !Run file of
the PC front-end.

The current version of this module will work with versions of the PC
front-end software 1.87 and above. However, significantly better performance
will be obtained if PCPro (!PC version 2.00 of higher) is used. The version
number is displayed in the Info window from the icon-bar icon. See the
Contacts documentation for details of how to obtain upgrades.
