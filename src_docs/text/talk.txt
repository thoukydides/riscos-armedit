INTRODUCTION

The !ARMEdit front-end supports several messages used by PC software. The
messages are arranged in pairs: code running on the PC card sends a message,
and the front-end sends an acknowledgement (with the same reason code). No
messages are sent from the front-end unrequested.

Messages from other sources are ignored. To test these messages from RISC OS
software it is necessary to use an ID of 0 (the same as for PC clients).

All of the messages use the ID 256.


MSG_ARMEDIT_FIND

    Check whether the front-end is running.
    
    Data sent:

        Offset  Size    Description
    
        0       4       Reason code = &00000000.
    
    Data returned:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000000.

    The PC software sends this message to ID 256 to find the handle of the
    front-end software. A timeout should be used to detect whether the
    message has been delivered.
    
    All future messages should use the message handle.


MSG_ARMEDIT_START

    Start an external edit.
    
    Data sent:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000001.
        4       4       Byte offset of initial cursor position.
        8       20      Null terminated DOS leaf name of file to edit.
        28      256     Null terminated name of RISC OS file to edit.
    
    Data returned:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000001.
        4       4       Handle for this edit.

    This message is used to start an external edit. The leaf name is used for
    display purposes - only the RISC OS name is used to access the file
    (which must exist when the message is sent).
    
    No status is returned by this message. Use MSG_ARMEDIT_POLL to check the
    state of the edit.
    
    A unique handle is returned for this file. This handle should be used
    when polling the status of the edit.


MSG_ARMEDIT_POLL

    Poll the status of the external edit.
    
    Data sent:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000002.
        4       4       Handle of edit to poll.
        8       4       Flags:
                            bit 0   Set to retrieve data.
                            bit 1   Set to end external edit.
                            bit 2   Set to mark file as safely saved.
    
    Data returned:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000002.
        4       4       Flags:
                            bit 0   Set if file modified since last poll.
                            bit 1   Set if external edit aborted.

    This message is used to check or update the status of an external edit.
    The input flags allow the file to be retrieved from the editor, or to
    abandon the edit. It is also possible to mark the edit as safely saved
    after it has been saved by the editor.
    
    If a request has been made to retrieve a file then the returned flags
    should be checked until the modified flag is set.
    
    If the returned flags indicate that the edit has been aborted then no
    more messages should be sent for this edit.


MSG_ARMEDIT_SAVEAS

    Display a Save As window for a specified file.
    
    Data sent:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000003.
        4       256     Null terminated name of RISC OS file to save.
        260     256     Null terminated suggested name of file to save.
    
    Data returned:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000003.

    Allow a file to be saved under a user specifiable name. This is intended
    for use by the PUTFILE command when no destination is specified. The
    file is deleted when it has either been saved, or when the user has
    cancelled the operation. No method for determining the success or
    failure of the operation is provided.
    

MSG_ARMEDIT_OSCLI_START

    Start executing a specified *command using a TaskWindow.
    
    Data sent:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000004.
        4       256     The null terminated command to execute.
        260     256     Name of the task to create.

    Data returned:
    
        Offset  Size    Description

        4       4       Handle for this command.

    This message is used to start a *command executing in a TaskWindow.
    
    A unique handle is returned for this command. This handle should be used
    when polling or ending execution of the command.


MSG_ARMEDIT_OSCLI_POLL

    Continue execution of a *command. 
    
    Data sent:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
        
        0       4       Reason code = &00000005.
        4       4       Handle of command to poll.
        8       4       Number of bytes to input.
        12      1000    Up to 1000 bytes of input.

        12      1000    Up to 1000 bytes of output.

    This message is used to send input or to receive any output from a
    *command running in a TaskWindow. Both input and output is buffered as
    required.
    

MSG_ARMEDIT_OSCLI_END

    Terminate execution of a *command.
    
    Data sent:
    
        Offset  Size    Description
