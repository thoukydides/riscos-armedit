INTRODUCTION

The "ARMEDIT" command allows DOS files to be edited using a RISC OS editor.
To use this command it is necessary to load the ARMEdit module before
starting the PC front-end, and to have both the !ARMEdit front-end and a
suitable RISC OS editor running.

The External Data Editing Protocol is used to control the edit. Both !Zap and
!StrongEd support this protocol (see comments below), but unfortunately !Edit
does not.


USAGE

The syntax is:

    ARMEDIT [/?] <file> [<file> [...]]
    ARMEDIT [/?] /L <file> [<line> [<file> [<line> [...]]]]

where

    /?              - Displays some help text.
    /L              - Filenames are followed by line numbers.
    <file>          - Wildcarded name of the files to edit.
    <line>          - Line number to position cursor at.

All files are treated as text files (RISC OS type &FFF) when being edited.


USE WITH ZAP

!Zap uses several techniques for choosing the mode to edit a file in. These
include using the filetype, filename and the contents of the file. Due to the
operation of the External Data Editing Protocol, only the file leaf name is
available. Hence, to enable selection of editing modes the following lines
should be placed at the start of the !Zap.Keys file:

&500	&FFF	\#\*/c			+C
&500	&FFF	\#\*/cc			+C
&500	&FFF	\#\*/c++		+C
&500	&FFF	\#\*/h			+C
&500	&FFF	\#\*/asm		+Assembler

Other mappings can be added in a similar fashion. Files that do not match any
of the patterns will be placed in the configured default mode (usually Text).

Note that !Zap will not automatically recognise DOS files and perform line end
mappings. This is because with the External Data Editing Protocol a blank
buffer is initially created, with the file contents being added later; it is
not possible to recognise the file type from the initial blank buffer.


USE WITH STRONGED

Some versions of !StrongEd do not support The External Data Editing Protocol
correctly. If you experience problems with the ARMEDIT utility still polling
edits that have been ended, then try upgrading to the latest version of
!StrongEd.


OTHER POINTS TO NOTE

If a suitable editor is not running, then the command will exit without
giving an error message - no attempt is made to automatically load a suitable
editor.

Filenames may contain standard DOS wildcards, i.e. "?" for single characters,
and "*" for multiple characters. Files are matched using the same rules as
used by other DOS commands.

The cursor position is selected by counting new-line (ASCII code 10)
characters. If the editor changes the line end character sequences then the
cursor may be positioned on the wrong line.
