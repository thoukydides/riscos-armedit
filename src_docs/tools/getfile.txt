INTRODUCTION

The "GETFILE" command is a replacement for the command of the same name that
was supplied with Acorn's software PC emulator. It allows RISC OS files to be
transferred to DOS. To use this command it is necessary to load the ARMEdit
module before starting the PC front-end.


USAGE

The syntax is:

    GETFILE [/?] [/M] [/P] [/S] <RISC OS file> [<DOS file>]

where

    /?              - Displays some help text.
    /M              - Enable multitasking during copying.
    /P              - Prompts before copying each file.
    /S              - Copy subdirectories.
    <RISC OS file>  - Wildcarded source RISC OS file specification to copy.
    <DOS file>      - The destination DOS path.

The source path may include standard RISC OS wildcards, i.e. "#" to match a
single character or "*" for multiple characters. Files are matched using the
same rules as used by RISC OS commands.

If no destination filename is specified then the source filename is used with
various character transformations performed.
