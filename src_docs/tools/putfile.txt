INTRODUCTION

The "PUTFILE" command is a replacement for the command of the same name that
was supplied with Acorn's software PC emulator. It allows DOS files to be
transferred to RISC OS. To use this command it is necessary to load the
ARMEdit module before starting the PC front-end.


USAGE

The syntax is:

    PUTFILE [/?] [/M] [/P] [/S] [/W] <DOS path> [<RISC OS path>]

where

    /?              - Displays some help text.
    /M              - Enable multitasking during copying.
    /P              - Prompts before copying each file.
    /S              - Copy subdirectories.
    /W              - Disable use of the "Save as" window.
    <DOS path>      - Wildcarded source DOS file specification to copy.
    <RISC OS path>  - The destination RISC OS path.

The source path may include standard DOS wildcards, i.e. "?" to match a
single character or "*" for multiple characters. Files are matched using the
same rules as used by other DOS commands.

If no destination filename is specified then the source filename is used with
various character transformations performed. Without the "/W" switch a RISC
OS "Save as" window is used to select a suitable destination; this requires
!ARMEdit to be running.

The filetype is selected using the mappings set up using the DOSMap command.
This is initially cached when the ARMEdit module starts, but may be reread at
any time using the command ARMEdit_DOSMap.
