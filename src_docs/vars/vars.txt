SYSTEM VARIABLES

The ARMEdit module sets and uses the following system variables:

    ARMEdit$Path
    
        Path used to access Messages file. This is normally set to point to
        the file contained within the module and placed in ResourceFS.
        
    
    ARMEdit$ScrapDir
    
        Directory used for temporary files. This is normally set to
        <Wimp$Scrap>.ARMEdit, but may be changed if required. If there is
        sufficient memory in the computer then better performance would
        result from placing this in a RAM disc.
        
        The module sets and uses this variable (if not already defined)
        during initialisation. Hence it is necessary for <Wimp$Scrap> to be
        defined before the module is loaded.
