/*
    Parameters  : stream    - The stream to redirect output to. This
                              defaults to stdout.
                  bytes     - Pointer to the bytes of data to output.
                  size      - The number of bytes to output.
    Returns     : void
    Description : An output stream prefilter. The function may write
                  directly to the screen rather than using the specified
                  stream.

/*
    Parameters  : riscos    - Should the code be converted into a standard
                              RISC OS keystroke.
    Returns     : int       - The extended or RISC OS key code, or 0 if no
                              key was pressed.
    Description : Read a single key from the input buffer, combining extended
                  key codes as required. This does not wait if the buffer is
                  empty. This can optionally translate codes into their
                  RISC OS equivalent.

/*
    Parameters  : cmd       - The command to execute.
                  stream    - Optional stream to redirect output to. If a
                              NULL pointer is passed then no redirection is
                              used.
    Returns     : int       - Standard C return code giving status of
                              operation.
    Description : Perform a *command simply. The { > file } method of
                  redirection is used if required. No redirection of input
                  is supported.

    Parameters  : cmd   - The command to execute.

                          passed then the keyboard is used for input.
                  out   - Stream to use for output. If a NULL pointer is
                          passed then stdout is used.
    Returns     : int   - Standard C return code giving status of operation.
    Description : Perform a *command with full redirection. Due to the way in
                  which the command may need to be suspended, the commands
                  that may be executed are more restricted.

    Parameters  : var   - The name of the variable to read, which may be
