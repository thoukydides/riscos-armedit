    Description : Aleph One High-level Procedure Call (HPC) interface.
                  If HPC support is not present then a less efficient, but
                  more widely supported, scheme is used without any extra
                  work by the client software.

    Parameters  : tx1_buf   - Pointer to the first portion of the data to
                              send.
                  tx1_size  - The size of the first portion of the data to
                              send.
                  tx2_buf   - Pointer to the second portion of the data to
                              send.
                  tx2_size  - The size of the second portion of the data to
                              send.
                  rx1_buf   - Pointer to the buffer to receive the first
                              portion of the reply.
                  rx1_size  - The size of the buffer to receive the first
                              portion of the reply.
                  tx1_buf   - Pointer to the buffer to receive the second
                              portion of the reply.
                  tx2_size  - The size of the buffer to receive the second
                              portion of the reply.
    Returns     : int       - The code returned by the HPC call.
    Description : Execute an HPC call, or a substitute if HPC not available.
                  Note that the HPC protocol imposes a maximum length of
                  transfer of 16384 bytes, although transfers over 4096 bytes
                  may be unreliable and are discouraged.
